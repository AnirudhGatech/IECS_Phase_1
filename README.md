## 📌 Overview

**GTSearch** is a domain-specific semantic search engine focused on Georgia Tech-related content. I built it to solve the problem of inaccurate or irrelevant results returned by general-purpose search engines and LLMs when answering academic or institutional queries.

The system combines intelligent web crawling, vector similarity-based filtering, and GPT-powered response generation—all built, tuned, and deployed by me.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔎 Georgia Tech-specific semantic search
- 🌐 Web crawler using Scrapy + FastEmbed for filtering
- 📦 Vector storage and search with Pinecone
- 💬 Contextual response generation using OpenAI GPT-3.5
- 🖥️ Full-stack web integration with Flask + React
- ☁️ Deployed on Render with continuous delivery support

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 📘 Crawling Module  
<img width="1440" alt="Crawler Design" src="https://github.com/kslohith/gtsearch/assets/32676813/11f09439-ca89-42ab-afdf-957bad5d33fa">

This module starts with seed URLs and filters crawled text based on semantic similarity with a Georgia Tech knowledge base embedding.

---

### 📗 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module  
<img width="1440" alt="RAG Flow" src="https://github.com/kslohith/gtsearch/assets/32676813/6025f4c4-f127-4761-8b65-a76a963f02bd">

For every user query, top-k relevant documents are retrieved from Pinecone and passed as context to GPT-3.5 to generate the final response.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install scrapy flask fastembed openai pinecone-client
```

### 🕷️ Run Crawler
```bash
scrapy crawl tsearch -o search.json
```

This will crawl relevant Georgia Tech pages and push the filtered data into Pinecone.

### 🌐 Start Flask Server
```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

### 📬 API Usage
```http
POST /tsearch/search
```
**Payload:**
```json
{
  "search_query": "What are good graduate courses in databases offered in Fall 2024?"
}
```

**Response:** A GPT-generated answer with context-aware results.
